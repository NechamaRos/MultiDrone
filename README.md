# MultiDrone

MultiDrone â€“ Real-Time Embedded System for Autonomous UAVs
A collaborative project for developing a real-time embedded system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system was implemented in C/C++ and utilized OpenCV for computer vision tasks. Focus was placed on writing stable, secure, and efficient code modules to support flight operations, target detection, and inter-drone communication.

Main Highlights:

Developed performance-critical code in C/C++ for drone control in real-time environments.

Integrated OpenCV to process image data for object tracking and recognition.

Designed and implemented modular and dependency-free components to ensure system stability.

Collaborated within an Agile team, using Git for version control and code collaboration.

Conducted debugging and profiling to enhance runtime performance and eliminate system bottlenecks.
